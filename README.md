## Description

kayo is the internal project and release management system used on [aixxe.net](https://kayo.aixxe.net).

I originally started this so I could have a basic self-hosted system for uploading project releases with detached PGP signatures. As always, one feature lead to five others and here we are.

## Key features

* Multiple users can be invited to maintain a project.
* Markdown formatted wiki, release and project description.
* Project releases can contain an optional detached PGP signature.
* Images and videos can be uploaded to the media section of a project.

# Additional requirements

* [GnuPG extension](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.gnupg.php)
